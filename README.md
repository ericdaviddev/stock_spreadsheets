# Stock Spreadsheet Processor VBA Macro

## üìå Overview
This VBA macro automates the processing of stock and bond position spreadsheets downloaded from a brokerage firm.  
It allows users to **filter out specific stock symbols** (from an exclusion list) and **calculate key totals** for the remaining positions.  
Additionally, the macro applies **basic formatting** to highlight important financial changes, making it easier to track gains and losses.

## üöÄ Features
- **Filters out excluded stock/bond symbols** so you can focus on relevant holdings.
- **Sums up key financial values** (e.g., total gains/losses, current value).
- **Formats the spreadsheet** for easier readability.
- **Supports `.csv` and `.xlsx` files**.

## üìÇ Installation ‚Äì How to Import the Macro
To use this VBA macro in **Microsoft Excel**, follow these steps:

1. **Open Excel** and press `Alt + F11` to open the **VBA Editor**.
2. In the **VBA Project Explorer** (left panel), right-click on `"Modules"` and choose `"Import File..."`.
3. Select the file: **`Module1.bas`** and click **Open**.
4. The macro will now appear under `"Modules"` in your VBA Editor.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run the Macro

2. The arguments are: folder_path (where main.py is), where to look for symbol files, output_file, exclusion_file, macro_file, macro_name
3. @echo off
4. python "C:\SomeLocation\stock_spreadsheets\api\main.py" "C:\SomeLocation\Downloads" "C:\SomeLocation\Documents\price_sheet.xlsx" "C:\SomeLocation\stock_spreadsheets\ExcludeSymbolsList.xlsx" "C:\SomeLocation\stock_spreadsheets\StockSymbolMacro.xlsm" "ProcessExclusionsAndTotals"
5. pause


## üìå Requirements
